# Test Upload Navigation

## Problem
When uploading a document, the navigation to the reading page is not happening.

## Debugging Steps

1. **Upload Process**
   - File is uploaded successfully
   - Document ID is generated
   - Document is added to the store
   - `onUploadComplete` callback is triggered with document ID

2. **Navigation Attempt**
   - `handleUploadComplete` is called with document ID
   - `navigate('/document/{id}')` is called
   - Navigation doesn't happen

## Potential Issues

1. **React Router Lazy Loading**: The ReadingPage component is lazy loaded, which might cause issues
2. **State Management**: The document might not be fully available when navigation happens
3. **Route Matching**: The route might not be matching properly

## Solution to Try

1. Add more debugging to understand exactly where the navigation fails
2. Try using a direct navigation approach
3. Ensure the document is fully loaded before navigation
