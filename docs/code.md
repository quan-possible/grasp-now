# Project Code Summary: grasp.now - Phase 1 COMPLETED ✅

This document provides a summary of the grasp.now document transformation platform codebase after successful Phase 1 completion and code refactoring.

## Overview

grasp.now is a React application with a simplified two-page architecture built with Vite and TypeScript. It features a clean separation between document management and reading experience, with Firebase backend services and Zustand state management. The application now has a unified lens system with integrated Milkdown editor, matching the intended design specifications perfectly.

## Recent Refactoring (December 2024)

✅ **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminated redundant components and achieved clean two-page structure  
✅ **Unified Reading Experience**: Single DocumentEditor with integrated lens switching  
✅ **Code Cleanup**: Removed legacy components, centralized types, optimized structure  
✅ **Design Alignment**: Interface now matches provided design screenshots exactly

### Core Application Components:

*   **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**: The main React application component with React Router integration.
    *   **Overall:** Manages authentication state and provides routing architecture using React Router v7.6.2.
    *   **Routing:** Implements `BrowserRouter` with routes for `/documents` (DocumentsPage) and `/document/:id` (ReadingPage).
    *   **State Management:** Uses `useAuthStore()` for authentication state management.
    *   **Authentication Integration:** Conditionally renders `Login` component for unauthenticated users or main app routes for authenticated users.
    *   **Navigation:** Automatic redirect to `/documents` for authenticated users at root path.

### State Management (located in `frontend/src/store/`):

*   **`authStore.ts`**: Zustand store for managing authentication state.
    *   **State**: Manages `user` (Firebase User), `loading` boolean, and setter functions.
    *   **Actions**: `setUser(user)`, `setLoading(loading)` for updating authentication state.

*   **`documentStore.ts`**: Comprehensive Zustand store for document and folder management.
    *   **State**: Manages `documents`, `folders`, `currentDocument`, `currentFolder`, loading states, upload progress tracking.
    *   **Document Actions**:
        *   `uploadDocument(file, folderId?)`: Handles file upload to Firebase Storage, text extraction, and Firestore document creation with progress tracking.
        *   `deleteDocument(id)`: Removes document from both Firestore and Storage.
        *   `updateDocument(id, updates)`: Updates document metadata.
    *   **Folder Actions**:
        *   `createFolder(name, parentId?)`: Creates new folder in Firestore.
        *   `updateFolder(id, updates)`, `deleteFolder(id)`: Folder management operations.
    *   **Real-time Subscriptions**: `subscribeToDocuments()` and `subscribeToFolders()` for real-time updates using Firestore listeners.
