    // User profile access
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Document access
    match /documents/{documentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;
      allow read: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.sharedWith;
      
      // Lens access
      match /lenses/{lensId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == 
          get(/databases/$(database)/documents/documents/$(documentId)).data.ownerId;
      }
    }
    
    // Folder access
    match /folders/{folderId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Strategy
