# Test Document for Upload Flow

This is a test document to verify that the upload-to-reading page navigation works correctly.

## Main Content

The document contains some sample content that will be transformed into various lenses:

- **Slide Lens**: Key points for presentations
- **Study Lens**: Detailed notes for learning
- **Story Lens**: Narrative format for engagement

## Testing

When uploaded, this document should immediately navigate to the reading page where users can:

1. View the document content
2. Switch between different lenses
3. Edit the content with the Milkdown editor

## Expected Behavior

Upload → Immediate navigation to `/document/{id}` → Reading page with lens selector

The upload flow should be seamless and provide immediate access to the document and its generated lenses.
